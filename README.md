This is the first entry of my first attempt at a machine learning/ data science project (project 1, day 1 of 42)

# Intro
My name is Brooklyn Bowers and I am an aspiring machine learning engineer/ data scientist. Like many trying to break 
into this field, I have started many different online courses but have little to show for it. I just finished my masters 
degree this week (woohoo :) ), so now I have a lot of time to devote to these projects. Using Daniel Burke's 42 day/ 
6 week idea, I will focus on this one project over 6 weeks, documenting what I am learning. I hope that by using this 
process, I will be able to land a job as a machine learning engineer/ data scientist. :) 

# Day 1 - ?
